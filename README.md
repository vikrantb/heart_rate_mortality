Project description

We will analyze heart-disease mortality data for the United States. The response variable will be mean mortality rate. The analysis will use a factorial design that compares mean mortality rates using factors for state, county, gender, and race/ethnicity.

Analysis questions

Global (across US) questions
•   Across the United States, is the mean mortality rate the same between genders?
•   Across the United States, is the mean mortality rate the same between different races/ethnicities?
•   Is the mean mortality rate same between different states in the United States? If not, which states show the greatest differences?

Nested (within state) questions
•   Within each state, is the mean mortality rate the same between genders? If not, which states show the greatest differences.
•   Within each state, is the mean mortality rate the same between different races/ethnicities? If not, which states show the greatest differences.
•   Within each state, is the mean mortality rate the same between counties? If not, which states show the greatest differences?

Interaction questions
•   Across the United States, is there an interaction between state and race/ethnicity on mortality rates?
•   Across the United States, is there an interaction between gender and race/ethnicity on mortality rates?
 

Data description

We are using the following dataset from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
Heart Disease Mortality Data Among US Adults (35+) by State/Territory and County – 2015-2017 

The following table describes the subset of columns from the dataset that we will use for our analysis.
